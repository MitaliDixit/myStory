once upon a time, in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on aberry tree,which was on a banks of a river,in the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife....
One day,the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits,the croc came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
AS the days passed they became good friends.
